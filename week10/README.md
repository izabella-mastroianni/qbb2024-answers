# week 10 exercise 3 questions

# 3.1
The nascent RNA signal is a measure of the real-time RNA transcription activity in the nucleus. The PCNA signal is a measure of what stage of the cell cycle the cell is in, including DNA replication. The log2 ratio of nascent RNA signal to PCNA signal measures the transcription in relation to the cell cycle stage, so we can see how RNA transcription changes in different cell cycle stages.

# 3.2
SRSF1 knockout results in the highest ratio. SRSF1 is an important splicing protein, and without it nascent RNAs would build up in the nucleus and not be spliced/processed completely, so this makes sense that KO of SRSF1 increased the ratio. 

APEX1 knockout results in the lowest ratio. APEX1 is a DNA repair protein, and without it there would be more DNA damage that isn't prepared and therefore increase the PCNA signal since this can also be used as a marker for DNA damage.
