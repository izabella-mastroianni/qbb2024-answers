# week 2, exercise 2.3 

1. Exons are under the highest level of purifying selection because these are the protein-coding parts of the genome and less flexible to changes and any changes in the protein could change its function. 

2. Lower MAFs mean that the SNPs are present in less of the population. Often SNPs are random mutations and take a long time to get propogated through the population. 

3. I feel like there should be the most SNPs in the other feature category, but it makes sense that introns can tolerate lots of SNPs since they aren't part of the protein coding sequence. Regulatory elements tolerating less SNPs than introns makes sense since they need some of their sequence to be conserved for function. Exons having the least enrichment makes sense because the protein-coding regions need to maintain their sequence to ensure continued function.
